# 3dRustGame - A Research Project

A toy renderer I built a couple years ago. It uses ray marching on the GPU as well a path traced lighting. I wanted to see if I could build it.

Most of the methods for path tracing were made by me. They might not be the best, but they get the job done.

## Screenshots from the project
